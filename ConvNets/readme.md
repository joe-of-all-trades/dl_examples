This folder contains various convolutional neural networks. CIFAR-10_basic is the simplest one. It's purpose is to demonstrate the most basic structure of a convolutional neural networks. 

More sophisticated architecture and methods are added in different version. CIFAR-10_VGG_NCHW is currently the one with most of the important techniques and achieves best results.
